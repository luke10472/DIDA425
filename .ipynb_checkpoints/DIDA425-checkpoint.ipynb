      "Comment: Probably not anytime soon (within next 5 years, at least). Many of its holdings were incredibly optimistically priced for future earnings, so the rise in interest rates will cause massive multiple contractions for most of their holdings as discount rates on future cashflows increase (which we have been seeing since February). On top of this, their largest holding, PLUG, was caught doing fraudulent accounting and is getting investigated by the SEC for it. Some of their holdings have been missing revenue and earnings estimates as well, which is causing individual holdings in this ETF to tank as well, further driving down the price. There are a lot of better growth-oriented investments that you could make instead of this IMO.\n",

The economics of many in ICLN actually have very little to do with the obvious broad shift toward increased consumption/production of clean energy. Everyone agrees this a good thing - but making earnings from it is a different story (and somewhat at odds with the objective of clean “renewable” energy in the first place). There is a big cannibalization problem and many of the heavy hitters, thus far, are really just public welfare business. As for the last 5 months in the price - ICLN was basically a meme stock for most of 2020 driving up the price irrationally\n",

      "For the last 12 months or so, the EV and energy transition space has exhibited just about every symptom that occurs with over priced and overinflated assets. If you don't believe me, go take a look at where most publicly traded EV stocks that were taken public by way of deSPAC IPO + merger with the SPAC entity. The private equity firm that funded the initial PIPE placement doesn't have the risk exposure that the public does, so what incentive do they have to push any sort of realistic valuation, especially when these offerings are 10x over subscribed.....based on 2030E revenue multiples.....that public investors will buy regardless based on anecdotal hype and cognitive dissonance on being a \"natural\" at stock picking, since most of these investor bought into the market in April 2020 and have realized 40%+ returns.......\n",
